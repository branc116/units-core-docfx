<h3>
This file is generated by Microsofts T4 tool.
I'd rather not commit this file, but I haven't found the way to automate the creation of this
file without microsofts T4 tool so for now we are stuck with having to push this file to git every time the new files are generated.

If anybody knows the way to auto generate without using microsofts tool, pleasr tell me.
