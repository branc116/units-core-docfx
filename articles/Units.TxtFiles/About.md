# About Units.txt files

Units.txt files is a text file that has definitions of units that you want the Units.Core tool to generate the code for.
It's made to be *easy to use*, *easy to understand*, *modular*, *extendable*, *declerative*.
Documentation for the sintax is available in related articles.

Easiest way to get familiar with the sintax is to read the [getting started](../gettingStarted.md) article.
